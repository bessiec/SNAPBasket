                <h3><a>Catie Peiper</a> <small>Co-founder/Partnerships</small></h3>
                <p>Catie is a first year Ph.D student at the USC School of Cinematic Arts in the Bryan Singer Division of Critical Studies. The inspiration for SNAPbasket began several years ago when the majority of Catie's monthly food budget depended on SNAP benefits; frustrated by the inequalities in local grocery pricing and the unpredictability of food inflation, she began compiling the pricing data for her local grocery stores that eventually became the early concept for SNAPbasket. Her goal, which is shared by the entire SNAPbaket team, is to make this data more easy collected and accessed, so that individuals working with limited budgets or who are dependent on SNAP benefits may be able to make the most of every dollar spent on food.Â
